Spring XD Samples
=================

This repository provides sample starter applications and code for use with the [Spring XD][] project. The following samples are available:

### analytics-dashboard

Standalone project which shows how you can use the [D3 Javascript library][] to create visualizations for Spring XD counters.

### batch-basic

Shows how to deploy a simple [Spring Batch][] process in [Spring XD][], without having to compile any code or install any jars.

### batch-hashtag-count

This sample will take an input file with Twitter JSON data and count the occurrences of hashtags.

### batch-notifications

This sample will take an input file containing payment data, and import the data into a database using [Spring XD][]'s batch job support. During import, various notification events are triggered and printed to the console.

### batch-simple

This is the quintessential *Hello World* example for [Spring XD][]. It consists of only one [Spring Batch] *Tasklet* which prints out `Hello Spring XD!`.

### batch-wordcount

This is the [Spring Batch word-count sample for Hadoop][] adapted for [Spring XD][]. This sample will take an input file and count the occurrences of each word within that document.

### kafka-message-bus

This sample walks you through setting up [Kafka][] as a message bus for [Spring XD][], also demonstrating partitining and failover.

### kafka-source

This sample walks you through setting up a [Kafka][] source in [Spring XD][], also demonstrating the use of multiple modules for ingestion efficiency.

### payload-conversion

This sample project implements a *custom processor* and demonstrates the use of the Tuple data type.

### pivotal-hd-demo

Demo using [Spring XD][] with [Pivotal HD][].
