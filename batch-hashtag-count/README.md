Spring XD Batch Hashtag Count Sample
=================================

This sample will take an input file with Twitter JSON data and counts the occurrences of hashtags.

## Requirements

In order for the sample to run you will need to have installed:

* Spring XD ([Instructions](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Getting-Started))
* Hadoop ([Instructions](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Hadoop-Installation))

## Building

Build the sample simply by executing:

	$ mvn clean assembly:assembly

As a result, you will see the following files and directories created under `target/batch-hashtag-count-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-bin/`:

```
|-- batch-hashtag-count-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-bin
|   |-- lib
|   |   `-- hadoop-examples-1.1.2.jar
|   |-- modules
|   |   `-- job
|   |       `-- hashtagcount.xml.xml
```

the modules/job directory defines the location of the file to import, HDFS directories to use as well as the name node location.  You can verify the settings inside wordcount-context.xml.  All relevant properties are defined in the util:property element:

	<util:properties id="myProperties" >
		<prop key="wordcount.input.path">/hashtagcount/in/</prop>
		<prop key="wordcount.output.path">/hashtagcount/out/</prop>
		<prop key="hd.fs">hdfs://localhost:8020</prop>
	</util:properties>

Please verify particularly the following property:

* hd.fs - The [Hadoop NameNode](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/NameNode) to use. The setting should be fine, but the port may be different between Hadoop versions (e.g. port 9000 is common also)

## Running the Sample

In the batch-wordcount directory

	$ cp target/batch-hashtag-count-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-bin/modules/job/* $XD_HOME/modules/job
	$ cp target/batch-hashtag-count-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-bin/lib/* $XD_HOME/lib

Now your Sample is ready to be executed. Start your *Spring XD* admin server (If it was already running, you must restart it):

	xd/bin>$ ./xd-singlenode

Now start the *Spring XD Shell* in a separate window:

	shell/bin>$ ./xd-shell

## Collect Twitter Data

	$ stream create --name tweets --definition "twitterstream | hdfs --rollover=10000000"

## Create the Batch Job

You will now create a new Batch Job Stream using the *Spring XD Shell*:

	xd:>job create --name hashtagCountJob --definition "hashtagcount"

Launch the job using:

	xd:>job launch hashtagCountJob

You should see a message:

	Successfully created and deployed job 'hashtagCountJob'

## Verify the result

First specify the Hadoop NameNode for the Spring XD Shell:

	xd:>hadoop config fs --namenode hdfs://localhost:8020
	
We will now take a look at the root of the *HDFS* filesystem:
	
	xd:>hadoop fs ls /

You should see output like the following:

	Found 4 items
	drwxr-xr-x   - hillert supergroup          0 2013-08-06 22:35 /Users
	drwxr-xr-x   - hillert supergroup          0 2013-08-12 11:01 /count
	drwxr-xr-x   - hillert supergroup          0 2013-08-09 11:31 /user
	drwxr-xr-x   - hillert supergroup          0 2013-08-08 10:53 /xd

As we declared the property `wordcount.output.path` in **hashtagcount.xml** to be `/hashtagcount/out/`, let's have a look at the respective directory:

	xd:>hadoop fs ls /hashtagcount/out
	Found 2 items
	-rw-r--r--   3 hillert supergroup          0 2013-08-10 00:07 /hashtagcount/out/_SUCCESS
	-rw-r--r--   3 hillert supergroup      31752 2013-08-10 00:07 /hashtagcount/out/part-r-00000

Finally, executing:

	xd:>hadoop fs cat /hashtagcount/out/part-r-00000

should yield a long list of hashtags, indicating the number of occurrences within the provided input snapshot of Twitter data.
